###*🚀 Getting Started*
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.
Prerequisites
 * Python 3.9+ installed.
 * pip (Python package installer).
Installation
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MovieRecommender.git
cd MovieRecommender

 * Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

 * Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
 * Download Datasets:
   * (Specify where to get your dataset, e.g., MovieLens 100k/1M/20M)
   * Place the dataset files (e.g., ratings.csv, movies.csv) into the data/ directory.
 * Explore the Jupyter Notebooks:
   * Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in your terminal:
     jupyter notebook

   * Navigate to the notebooks/ directory.
   * Start with 01_Data_Exploration.ipynb to understand the data.
   * Proceed to 02_Content_Based_Recommendation.ipynb and 03_Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb to see the recommendation logic in action.
 * Run the Recommendation Script (if available):
   python main.py --user_id 123
# Or, if using a web interface:
streamlit run app.py

   (Adjust script names and arguments as per your project structure.)
